# Whisper_Streamlit_Web_APP

# üéôÔ∏è Audio Transcription App

This project is a simple Streamlit app for recording audio, transcribing it using the Whisper ASR model, and displaying the transcription. The project follows a basic model-view architecture with separate files for the main logic (`main.py`) and the Streamlit app (`streamlit.py`).

Additionally, there is a script named `whisper_test.py` that demonstrates how to transcribe already downloaded audio files using the Whisper ASR model. This script processes audio files within a specified folder and generates a CSV file with audio filenames and their corresponding transcriptions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dhruv716/Speech-to-text.git
